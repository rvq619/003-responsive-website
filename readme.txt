Here are the functions they perform:

- A header element is used for the site name, logo etc. Other sections of the page can also have their own header element.
- A nav element is used for navigation links, such as a top, side or footer menu.
- A section element is used to contain the main content of an article or a significant area of a page. 
- An aside element defines a small sub-section that relates to a main section. 
- A main element wraps other elements unique to the page. In our example, these are the section and aside elements. The other elements will repeat across other pages. 
- A footer element is used for the site's legal name, dates etc. Other sections of the page can also have their own footer element.
